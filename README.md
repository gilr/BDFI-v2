## About

Development of the new version of a website dedicated to speculative fiction. 
The project will be developed as a multi-language project, even if its primary target is a french-speaking website.
This website will be a non-commercial and non-profit project, without any advertising.

As it is developed for a specific scope, it should not be of great interests for people outside our small team, except maybe as an example of a laravel project.

## Help?
Any help or advice from people familiar with Laravel ecosystem and/or people who love the speculative fiction is welcome!

## Based on Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## ... And Jetstream

Laravel Jetstream is a beautifully designed application scaffolding for Laravel. Jetstream provides the perfect starting point for your next Laravel application and includes login, registration, email verification, two-factor authentication, session management, API support via [Laravel Sanctum](https://github.com/laravel/sanctum), and optional team management.

Jetstream is designed using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and offers your choice of [Livewire](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/livewire.html) or [Inertia](https://jetstream.laravel.com/1.x/stacks/inertia.html) scaffolding.
